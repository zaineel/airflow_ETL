# Airflow ETL Project

This project is an example of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using Apache Airflow.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use Airflow to orchestrate and automate the ETL process. It showcases the following key components:

- DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for defining the workflow
- Operators for performing various tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading
- Connections and Variables for managing external resources and configurations
- Scheduling and monitoring capabilities provided by Airflow

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/zaineel/airflow_ETL.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure the Airflow environment: Update the `airflow.cfg` file with your desired settings.
4. Initialize the Airflow database: `airflow initdb`
5. Start the Airflow web server and scheduler: `airflow webserver -p 8080` and `airflow scheduler`

## Usage

Once the Airflow server is up and running, you can access the Airflow UI by navigating to `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser. From there, you can:

- View and manage the DAGs
- Trigger manual runs of the DAGs
- Monitor the status and progress of the tasks
- View logs and task execution details
